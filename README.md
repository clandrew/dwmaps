# Deathwish MUD Maps
This is a repo storing mainly some ASCII-based maps for the RPG "Deathwish", a game I've played for some years and am still playing. To get to know more about the game, visit its homepage here: http://dw.kicks-ass.org.

Deathwish is played over Telnet. If you want to play right away, point your MUD or Telnet client to telnet://amud.kicks-ass.org port 1111.

What this repo **does** contain:
* Textual map data describing room names
* Things from which you could infer fast travels
* My opinions of the difficulty of zones and some of their features

What this repo does **does not** contain:
* Item or room descriptions
* Spoilers
* Anything you can not observe as a mortal

There's also a stash of some maps of 3-D areas from a different game, Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode for NES, for lack of some better place to put them.
