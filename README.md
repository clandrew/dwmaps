# Deathwish MUD Maps
This is a repo storing ASCII-based maps for the RPG "Deathwish", a game I've played for some years and am still playing. To get to know more about the game, visit its homepage here: http://dw.kicks-ass.org.

Deathwish is played over Telnet. If you want to play right away, point your MUD or Telnet client to telnet://amud.kicks-ass.org port 1111.
